As a part of the course Experts in Team (EiT) at NTNU, five students were put in a group to collaborate on a project. This team (us) was a part of the virtual reality village of EiT, and came up with the following problem statement:

\begin{center}\em How can you make an affordable and usable prototype\\for head tracking to be used for virtual reality?\end{center}
\vspace{\parskip}

We solved this problem by first doing a preliminary study followed by design and imlementation of the solution. In the preliminary study, several technical and theoretical subjects were investigated. The mathematics behind estimation of object position from pictures were elaborated. We looked at the available technology for connecting a high definition camera to a PC. We checked out and tested the Nintendo Wii and its Wiimotes. And potential areas of use for a solution was described.

Then, a specification of the requirements was carefully crafted. The specification was the basis for the design of the solution. This design specifies how the components of the system is constructed and how they are connected.
