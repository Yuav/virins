The head moves by rotation and translation, or
yaw, pitch, roll, left/right, up/down or forward/back, which sums up to six degrees of freedom(6DOF).
Head tracking refers to the estimation of rotation, translation or both, usually based on 
optical sensors like cameras and infrared lights.

The system can be compared to the commercial TrackIR\ref{trackir} or the freely available FreeTrack\ref{freetrack}

The solution proposed here calculates head translation and thus provides 3DOF head tracking. 
This is sufficient since virtual reality, by accurate 3D perspective projection, is only dependant on head translation.
However, depending on which mode the system is in, which can be either one optical sensor mode or two optical sensors mode,
the user will still have 5DOF and 6DOF movement respectively. 

Two demonstration applications showing the use of head tracking and accurate 3D perspective projection are included in the solution.
The first demonstration application shows how an illusion of objects breaking the surface in the screen can be achieved using head tracking,
giving a very immersive experience. The second demonstration is an equally or even more immersive game, where the player must avoid
obstacles hurdled towards him, by ducking, jumping and dodging side-to-side.
